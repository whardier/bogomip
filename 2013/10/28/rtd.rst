=================================
Blog migration to readthedocs.org
=================================

This is just a post saying I'm going to be moving my old blog over here one 
article at a time.  This gives me the amazing opportunity to use good markup.. 
good extensions.. and really have control of the content on my blog.
                                                                   
If you aren't already aware of `readthedocs.org`_ please check it out.  I'm 
using it for several projects right now:
    
* `MongoLikeCandy`_
* `GloboFS`_
* `AllYourDatabase`_

The guys on #readthedocs on IRC (freenode) are pretty helpful as well :)

I have to get a few things working out with the theme so that I can add in the 
RSS XML

There's a few gotchas with how the table of contents works as well and I need to 
figure out how to set a **parent** page to some degree.  We'll see how well that 
works out.

Also will need to add back in `Disqus`_ comments which won't be that difficult.. 
I already have code for sphinx for that.
