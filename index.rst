Bogus Millions of Instructions Per (Bogomip)
============================================

I'm not sure if you're familiar with `BogoMIPS`_ but it's been around for a 
while in the Linux community.  It's always been easy for me to see acronyms like 
**BogoMIPS** as plural, especially when it is a measured unit of something.  It 
makes perfect sense that a BogoMIP is a single unit of a BogoMIPS measurement.

So.. I've held on to this domain for quite some time.  I love phrases, 
expressions, and strange ways to say things.  Bogomip.com is just one of those 
things and it is my attempt to tie myself to the Linux and Free and Open Source 
through obscure references.

My name is Shane.. and this is my space for stuff on the Internet.
